# 🚀 Welcome to the Mega Repo of Code Chaos!  
👋🏻 **Hey there, brave soul!**  
So, if you’ve just stumbled upon this repository and noticed 100+ initial commits and a sudden explosion of folders all at once — don't worry, I haven't been possessed by a caffeine-fueled coding demon.  
  
Instead, I decided to Marie Kondo my GitHub and consolidate all my scattered little code experiments, practice projects, and reference snippets into one mighty repository: **learning_to_code**  
  
**Why, you ask?**  
Well, I figured it's about time I stopped creating a new repo every time I wrote a for loop or experimented with a new language feature. This way, all my coding escapades are neatly packed in one place, and my bigger projects won’t be buried under a pile of 'hello world' programs and half-baked algorithms.  
  
**What’s in here?**  
You’ll find everything from my early ventures into coding to more recent projects, all conveniently organised into folders that reflect my gradual (and sometimes chaotic) journey through the world of programming.  
  
**TL;DR**  
This is my digital junk drawer — minus the old batteries and random screws. Browse around, and who knows, you might just find a gem in the chaos!
